  <h2>10.5 Part 2: Intersection</h2>
  <p> Part 2 of our list requires us to determine when the catcher and a raindrop intersect. Intersection functionality is what we want to focus on developing in this step. We will start with a simple bouncing ball class (which we saw in Example5-6) and work out how to determine when two bouncing circles intersect. During the “ integration ”process, this intersect( ) function will be incorporated into the Catcher class to catch raindrops.  </p>

Pseudocode: <br>
 • Erase background. <br>
 • Draw an ellipse at the mouse location. <br><br>
 
Translating it into code is easy: <br>

 void setup() { <br>
   size(400,400); <br>
   smooth(); <br>
 } <br>
 
 void draw() { <br>
 background(255); <br>
 stroke(0); <br>
 fill(175); <br>
 ellipse(mouseX,mouseY,64,64); <br>
 } <br>
 
 <p>This is good step, but we are not done. As stated, our goal is to develop the rain catcher program in an object-oriented manner. When we take this code and incorporate it into the final program, we will want to have it separated out into a class so that we can make a “ catcher ”object. Our pseudocode would be revised to look like the following. </p>

 Setup: <br>
 • Initialize catcher object. <br><br>
 Draw: <br>
 • Erase background. <br>
 • Set catcher location to mouse location. <br>
 • Display catcher. <br><br>
 
  Example 10-1: Catcher <br>
 Catcher catcher; <br>
 void setup() { <br>
 size(400,400); <br>
 catcher = new Catcher(32); <br>
 smooth(); <br>
 } <br><br>
 void draw() { <br>
 background(255); <br>
 catcher.setLocation(mouseX,mouseY); <br>
 catcher.display(); <br>
 }<br>
 
 <p>The Catcher class itself is rather simple, with variables for location and size, and two functions, one to set the location and one to display. </p>

class Catcher { <br>
 float r; // radius <br>
 float x,y; // location <br>
 Catcher(float tempR) { <br>
 r = tempR; <br>
 x = 0; <br>
 y = 0; <br>
 } <br><br>
  void setLocation(float tempX, float tempY) { <br>
 x = tempX; <br>
 y = tempY; <br>
 } <br><br>
 void display() { <br>
 stroke(0); <br>
 fill(175); <br>
 ellipse(x,y,r*2,r*2); <br>
 } <br>
 } <br>
